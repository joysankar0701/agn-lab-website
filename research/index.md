AGN Lab conducts research on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Blazars, aiming to understand their complex physical processes through multiwavelength observations. The lab specializes in Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling to analyze emission across different energy bands, from radio to gamma rays. By combining observational data with theoretical frameworks, AGN Lab seeks to unveil the nature of high-energy astrophysical phenomena.
